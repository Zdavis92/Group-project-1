                <li style="color: #673AB7;">
                    You should work out because it makes you happy.
                    <p>
                        Why bother with this whole "exercise" trend? I mean, hell. It's hard work. It's time-consuming.
                        Your
                        body aches. Your butt smells like goat cheese. (Anyone? No? Only me?) It ain't exactly a pony
                        ride.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        And yet there are reasons (good reasons it seems) why people go the gym, love the gym, can't
                        seem to
                        operate without their gym time. They literally train their cabooses off-whether that's in the
                        gym,
                        on the pavement, or on the mats, fields, and courts. It seems as though they couldn't imagine
                        life
                        without exercise.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li style="color: #009688;">
                    You should work out to make your life easier.
                    <p>
                        Setting and achieving goals inside the weight room helps you set and achieve goals outside the
                        weight room. The goal-setting/goal-accomplishing cycle is a learned trait. From a very early
                        age,
                        winners start to reinforce this idea that if they set their mind to something and tirelessly
                        work
                        towards its accomplishment, the outcome will be positive.Archbishop Leon Joseph Cardinal Suenens
                        said it well, "Happy are those who dream dreams and pay the price to make those dreams come
                        true."
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li style="color: #4CAF50;">
                    You should work out because it helps you win at life.
                    <p>
                        I don't want to get too sappy (it'll ruin my street cred) but the people closest to you rely on
                        your
                        love, energy, and compassion. Mismanaging your body is a disservice to them.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This holds true for young mothers, aging grandparents, or loving husbands. Taking care of your
                        relationship with self is the first step towards taking care of your relationship with others.
                        Making time for exercise is absolutely, positively, in NO WAY an act of selfishness. Quite the
                        opposite: It's an act of generosity. The people around you deserve your best. The best version
                        of
                        you is a version that is constantly challenged and improved with a kick-ass exercise routine.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li style="color:#FF9800;">
                    You should work out for your family and friends.
                    <p>
                        Initially, it's easy to view exercise as a chore. Consider this instead: Exercise is a blessing.
                        Not
                        only do you have the knowledge and the means to exercise (how fortunate), but you've been given
                        a
                        body that is strong as a friggin' tank, fast a cheetah, and more agile than a jackrabbit. OK,
                        perhaps that is slightly overstated, but a healthy body is truly a work of art.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li style="color: #795548;">
                    You should work out because you can.
                    <p>
                        'Cause the ladies like a guy with a little sweat on his brow. And the broski's like a babski
                        with a
                        little chalk on her hands.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        These are only a few of the millions of good reasons to hit the gym. Simply put, exercise makes
                        for
                        a more awesome life. Do me a favor and send this to someone who doesn't workout. They'll thank
                        you
                        later.

        <p> The body mass index (BMI) is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy.</p>
        <h6>BMI takes into account natural variations in body shape, giving a healthy weight range for a particular height.</h6>
        <p> Muscle is much denser than fat, so very muscular people, such as heavyweight boxers, weight trainers and athletes, may be a healthy weight even though their BMI is classed as obese.</p>
